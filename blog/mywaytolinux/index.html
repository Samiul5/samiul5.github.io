  My Way To Linux
  </h1>


  <p class="date">2022-06-18</p>
  <h2> ○ GNU/Linux </h2>
<p>
Linux is a operating system which enables a man to use the
full potential of a computer and technology. It enables a
man to use his creativity through many stages. In linux there are
many stages such as if you consider that you have some sort of creativity in yourself
then there is a thing in linux called bash scripting can let
you use your brain and do what ever you want.
</p>
<p>
<p>I at first Like the customization of linux. Altough it is open source operating system.
That's the main fact that it is so customizable. Moreover the linux operating system is sperated in many distros or distributions.
Such as Ubuntu (which was my first linux distro I had choosen), Debian, Fedora, Manjaro, Gentoo, Void, Arch(Which I am currently using as my daily driver) and many more.</p>

<h2> ○ Ubuntu experience</h2>
<p> 
<p>Ubuntu is nice but for newbie who switches from windows to linux.
On that time I was new to linux. Didn't knew the fundamental linux laws. So that's why 
had to suffer a lot. Further more I had to encounter many errors and so much work. But now I consider that it was nothing
in comparison to Arch linux. I was saying about the after installation work to do. Ubuntu Installation was easy as it got a GUI.
A bit similer to Windows. After Installation the real thing comes up. Setting up drivers hmm. It is the most difficult part of Linux.
If you got the hardware which is owned by a small number of people then you might have to suffer to find the correct program for it :). </p>
</p>
<p> I face this with my wireless network adapter and still facing it but somehow I made it less difficult. Also installing Graphics Driver
is some sort of pain. Specially if you have Nvidia GPUs. One thing I want add is that I made everything more difficult by considering too much
. Simple mind makes a work smooth which I guess. After getting done with this part I went nice. I was able to do everything like a 
basic computer user. Playing Games,Browsing the internet and etc was easy. But slowly it started being like windows. Yes it is bloated
cause I wanted to customize the desktop enviorment. Also Snap package manager contributed so much to make my OS dull. On the point of 
time I didn't knew that. So day advances and I found about minimalism and Window Manager(DWM). I inspired from a Youtuber called bugswriter.
I liked his Desktop enviorment badly. So I decied that I must need to go With ArchLinux and DWM. And that was the end of Ubuntu from my
life
</p>
<h2> ○ Arch Linux experience</h2>

<h3>[Arch Linux Setup With DWM]</h3>
<p>
Installing the system wasn't hard but system partitioning was tricky. Altough system disk partitioning is a part of system installation.
I followed some Youtube Videos. To be honest I didn't like to read documents such as Archwiki. It took a long time to install because I had
to multitask for instance looking at the video and inputing those commands as a beginner was so difficult :). Then the driver installation
went same as ubuntu. Here I selected a window manager which is <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">DWM</a> from suckless. It is so nice.
Hopefully you can see a image up there which is showing my desktop enviorment. I don't know how it is but in perspective it was my
best customization of my WM.

<p>
<p>After switching to Arch Linux I learned many stuff such as Youtube is not only the source to get help, Solving problems instead avoiding it,
Bash Scripting, How a Operating system works and many more. If you switch to linux doesn't matter what Distro it is you will learn
great things. Now on Arch I can do anything I want also it has some limitations. I can't use Adobe products and I left using those since
I quit making Youtube videos. Sometimes I need a Photo and Video editor so for that perpose I use Gimp and Kdenlive. Willing to use Davinci Resolve
but it has some issue also which can be fixed. On Arch it is some minimal I got 16 gigabyte ram but don't need more then 8 gigabyte. On idle
it uses roughly 300 megabyte ram. Finally i can say using linux is Best but it not for all perpose. Linux is used in servers and now days
people are also being encouraged to use Linux. But still Windows got everything. Majority amount of Designers and Gamers aren't switching
to Linux for compatibility perpose. Can't say when all thing will be available in Linux. But still Linux is Best in my perspective.</p>
